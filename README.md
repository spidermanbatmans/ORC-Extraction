Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a powerful technology that enables machines to recognize and extract text from images or scanned documents. OCR finds applications in various fields, including document digitization, text extraction from images, and text-based data analysis. In this article, we will explore how to use PaddleOCR, an advanced OCR toolkit based on deep learning, for text detection and recognition tasks. We will walk through a code snippet that demonstrates the process step-by-step.

Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let’s ensure we have everything set up to run the PaddleOCR library. Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

    Python (3.6 or higher)
    PaddleOCR library
    Other necessary dependencies (e.g., NumPy, pandas, etc)

You can install PaddleOCR using the following pip command:

Setting up PaddleOCR

Once you have Python and the required libraries installed, let’s set up PaddleOCR. You can use PaddleOCR’s pre-trained models, which are available for text detection and recognition.
Code Overview

The code snippet for text detection and recognition using PaddleOCR consists of the following main components:

    Image Preprocessing: Load the input image and perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as resizing or normalization.
    Text Detection: Utilize the PaddleOCR text detection model to locate bounding boxes around the text regions in the input image.
    Text Recognition: For each detected bounding box, use the PaddleOCR text recognition model to extract the corresponding text.
    Post-processing: Organize the detected text and recognition results for further analysis or display.

Step-by-Step Implementation

Let’s break down the code snippet and explain each step in detail:

    Text Detection

The code is a part of a class named DecMain, which is designed for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) evaluation using ground truth data. It uses PaddleOCR to extract text from images and then calculates metrics like precision, recall, and Character Error Rate (CER) to evaluate the performance of the OCR system.

class DecMain:
    def __init__(self, image_folder_path, label_file_path, output_file):
        self.image_folder_path = image_folder_path
        self.label_file_path = label_file_path
        self.output_file = output_file

    def run_dec(self):
        # Check and update the ground truth file
        CheckAndUpdateGroundTruth(self.label_file_path).check_and_update_ground_truth_file()

        df = OcrToDf(image_folder=self.image_folder_path, label_file=self.label_file_path, det=True, rec=True, cls=False).ocr_to_df()

        ground_truth_data = ReadGroundTruthFile(self.label_file_path).read_ground_truth_file()

        # Get the extracted text as a list of dictionaries (representing the OCR results)
        ocr_results = df.to_dict(orient="records")

        # Calculate precision, recall, and CER
        precision, recall, total_samples = CalculateMetrics(ground_truth_data, ocr_results).calculate_precision_recall()

        CreateSheet(dataframe=df, precision=precision, recall=recall, total_samples=total_samples,
                    file_name=self.output_file).create_sheet()
